# **How might we use VR and AR to promote empathy and new ways of learning in the world?**

Join a select group of collaborators at California College of the Arts in San Francisco, CA from 10am-5pm on November 11th to Think Wrong to imagine creative solutions for using VR and AR to drive a positive future.

## **What’s a Blitz?**

Imagine TED meets Stanford d.School meets hackathon meets startup blackbelts. Imagine getting months of work done in less than 1 day. Imagine coming up with solutions together that we could not conceive of on our own.

Blitzes are intense, fun, hands-on sessions to produce a portfolio of small bets to address our biggest challenges.

## **Our process**
- **Be Bold:** Start with the dent in the universe you want to make. Are you thinking big enough? Ignore the naysayers. Dare to make a profound difference.
- **Think Wrong:** Your brain has habits. Thinking wrong breaks those synaptic connections freeing you to solve in new ways.
- **Bet Small:** There comes a time to stop talking and to start making. Build something fast. You might be surprised by how much you learn from doing.
## **What is Thinking Wrong?**

The creative, original, practical use of existing resources to solve big challenges—fast!
